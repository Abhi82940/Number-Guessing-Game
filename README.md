# Number-Guessing-Game
A command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedbackâ€”whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts like conditionals, loops, user input handling, and random number generation.
